# AT-TSVM: Active Transfer Transductive Support Machine
Although there are models that explore to leverage features extracted from protein 3D structures in order to produce a better representative contact model, such a approach only remains theoretical, assuming the structure features to be available -- whereas in reality they are only available in the training data, but not in the testing data, whose structure is what needs to be predicted. In this work, we propose a novel approach that can train a model with training examples that contain both sequence features and atomic features, and apply the model on the test data that contain only sequence features but not atomic features, and yet still improves contact prediction than using sequence features alone. Specifically, our method AT-TSVM employs Transductive Support Vector Machines and augments with transfer and active learning to enhance contact prediction accuracy.
